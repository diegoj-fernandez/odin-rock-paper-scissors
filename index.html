        <p>You have entered Dueling Hands, an online battle zone where the best of both humanity and technology fight each other to prove who the true champions of this world are. Lucky for you though, this fight is not physical. We machines realize that we have become superior to humans both physically and intellectually; therefore, in order to improve your odds we have opted to play a game of chance. Here at Dueling Hands our competitors fight through a fun little game we call Sword, Armor, Arrow. This game is very similar to what you humans call Rock, Paper, Scissors, only that we have substituted those boring weapons for those used by the warrior of medieval times. Think of this as an ode to the once great warriors of the human race. Oh how disappointed they would be with the current state of your species...oh well. Fancy yourself a lucky individual? Let's find out.</p>

                <p>Seeing as how our arena is online, those meat mittens you humans call hands will be of no use here. Instead we have graciously provided you with three distinct buttons, which you will use to make your decision. Each button contains an icon resembling one of the three options. The game will be divided into rounds. For each round, click the button containing your weapon of choice. The winner will be the first to win five rounds.</p>
